Jerry would scurry up a wall, only to disappear into the very fabric of the mansion itself.\n",

            "In the end, it was not the cat or the mouse that emerged victorious, but something far more sinister. The mansion itself seemed to come alive, its walls closing in on the two adversaries. Tom and Jerry were consumed by the darkness, their eternal chase reduced to a mere memory, a cautionary tale of the horrors that lurked in the shadows.\n",
